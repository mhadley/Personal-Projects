Thank you for taking interest in my programs!

This repository is here primarily as a display of what I've learned in my efforts to delve into the world of software development.
Currently there will only be somewhat rudimentary programs using the C language, though once I become fluent in this language I
do hope to pick up others, such as Python, C#, Rust, and whatever else I can.

Whether you're here because you're curious about my progress (or are interested in hiring me, perhaps?) Once again, I thank you for your interest.

PROGRAM LIST:

Area Calculator (2d Shapes) - A simple calculator. This is actually version 2 of my old one, though my inexperience using Github
has resulted in me accidentally deleting the old version without thinking to back it up. This version utilizes a simple switch
statement and a loop feature using goto and labels. ALL THE FORMULAS (ASIDE FROM THE CIRCLES) ROUND TO THE SECOND DECIMAL NUMBER.
